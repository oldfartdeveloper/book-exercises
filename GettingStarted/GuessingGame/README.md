# README

This is the exercise in Chapter in *the Book*.

## What I discovered here:

1. That GitHub's **Copilot** AI works really well under VSCode for this Rust setup. I tried extending this simple game with a better diagnostic message, and Copilot was excellent at printing as much of the code needed as possible.
1. But it generated junk as well.  The junk can cause compile errors that are really weird to figure out.  I suspect I'll get better at debugging it as I get better in Rust. But, in the meantime, I discovered a convenient workaround:

> Watch for the white code generated by Copilot.  Frequently, it will generate a few white characters out of nowhere as it tries to adjust code in multiple places.  Those are where the compile errors will come out.

The "if it compiles it runs" promise has held up 100% during this exercise.

Finally, `Cargo` can be incredibly useful.  Its way of generating package docs is ingenious; a simple terminal command: `cargo doc --open` opens a web page in a local web server that contains a full API catalog for all the packages that **Cargo** has imported into your project.  In other words, *everything you need without what you don't need*.

Here's an example output:

## Summary

1. I already had high expectations for Rust; so far it has met them.
1. Copilot is already proving to be very useful; it's generating good stuff.  Allows me to keep moving and I learn Rust syntax by watching what it generates.
1. **Cargo** makes the Haskell and PureScript package API documentation look cumbersome by comparison.
